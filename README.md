OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

Project:MULTITHREADED CHAT APPLICATION

Objective:

The main objective of a Multithreaded Chat Application using Java is to enable real-time communication between multiple users through a client–server architecture. The application uses Java socket programming for network communication and multithreading to handle multiple clients simultaneously without interruption.

This project aims to demonstrate how a server can manage multiple client connections at the same time, where each client is handled by a separate thread. Multithreading ensures that one user’s messages do not block or delay others, providing smooth and efficient communication.

Additionally, the application helps in understanding core Java concepts such as threads, sockets, input/output streams, and concurrency management. It is designed to build practical networking skills and simulate real-world messaging systems by allowing users to send and receive messages in real time.

Overall, the objective is to create a scalable, efficient, and reliable chat system that showcases Java’s capability to support concurrent network-based applications.

Key Activities:

*Designing a client–server architecture
